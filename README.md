# My Anime Picker

I created this website because I am a big fan of anime and I've never come across a website that helps new or existing anime fans discover new shows to watch. I wanted to make it be able to narrow down shows based on the users genre preferences. Users will click on the genres they enjoy and when they click the submit button a picture of the recommended anime will show up on screen. This obviously isn't fully functioning right now so I entered 5 or 6 pictures of random animes to simulate how the website would work when it is completed.

List of required features

- Implemented Javascript to create functioning dropdown menus to select a genre.
- Added a GIF that dissappears after clicking the submit button.
- Made it to where the GIF dissappears when the screen is shrunk to a certain size.
- When the submit button is clicked, a random image of a show replaces the original GIF.
