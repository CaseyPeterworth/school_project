I created this website because I am a big fan of anime and I've never come across a website that helps noew or existing anime fans discover new shows to watch. I wanted to make it be able to narrow down shows based on the users genre preferences. Users will click on the genres they enjoy and when they click the submit button a picture of the recommended anime will show up on screen. This obviously isn't fully functioning right now so I entered 5 or 6 pictures of random animes to simulate how the website would work when it is completed. I implemented javascript in the dropdown bar genre menus, added a GIF that dissappears after clicking submit and is then replaced by a random image of an anime, and also made it to where the GIF is hidden when the screen is made smaller.
